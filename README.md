# Faculty_Satisfaction_Turnover

This analysis, my third dissertation chapter, examines the job satisfaction and turnover intentions of non-tenure track faculty using data from the HERI Faculty Survey.  Job satisfaction was modeled in a structural equation framework using 19 items on job satisfaction in a measurement model.  The predictor variable was a binary variable turnover intentions, for whether a faculty member had thought about leaving academia.
